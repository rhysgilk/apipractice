    <div>The API that I selected is called musixmatch which is a database which contains lyrics for songs</div><br/>
    <div>https://developer.musixmatch.com</div><br/>
    <div>I used the same methods as talked about in class. I used the track.lyrics.get method in order to return the lyrics from a given track id. Within the lyrics JSON, it is divided into many sub categories. I had to traverse to "body", "message", "lyrics" and "lyrics_body" in order to get the lyrics which were then printed.<br/>Other methods that I could have used were the search track function which I attempted to implemented, but it was buggy. This method allows the user to input an artist and I can access the top tracks from the search results and get the track_id from the results, which I would pass in to the get lyrics method.</div><br/>
    <div>One application is for a website which has background music and you want to display the lyrics to the song and any other information about the song. Another application could be for a portfolio of an artist. This artist could display all of the lyrics of their music. A last application could be for a karaoke website which needs lyrics to display to the user to sing along to.</div>
